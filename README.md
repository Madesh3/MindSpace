# Inspiration

More than 4 in 10 (42%) students face mental health challenges, and we've all had days when stress makes school even tougher. This platform empowers teachers with real-time insights into students' well-being and provides AI-driven suggestions to adjust lessons and workloads, creating a more supportive and successful classroom environment.

# What it does

MindSpace is a Mental Health Platform for School Students (K-12), designed to help teachers understand their students' emotional and mental well-being through real-time polls. It provides AI-generated suggestions (via the Gemini API) on how to structure lessons and manage workloads based on students' moods and feelings.

# How we built it

We built this platform using a combination of Firebase for real-time data storage, Gemini AI to generate personalized suggestions for teachers, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end interface. The platform collects and analyzes students' emotional data through simple polls and uses AI to recommend how teachers can adapt their lessons and workloads to best support their students' mental well-being.

# Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating Firebase for real-time data collection and ensuring seamless storage and retrieval of students' poll responses. Managing the dynamic data flow while keeping the interface responsive was crucial. Another challenge was integrating the Gemini API to generate personalized suggestions for teachers. Ensuring the API could process real-time emotional data from students and return meaningful, actionable feedback required precise coordination between our back-end and front-end systems. On top of that, we struggled with Wi-Fi issues at Cal Hacks, constantly having to move around to find the best spot to work. Despite these obstacles, we balanced the technical challenges while maintaining an easy-to-use interface, making the process rewarding.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

Weâ€™re incredibly proud of building this web app in just 48 hours with a team of only two. Over the course of the hackathon, we developed an 11-page platform that integrates Firebase for real-time data and the Gemini API for AI-driven suggestions. Despite the tight deadline and small team size, we successfully created a fully functional app that empowers teachers to better support their students' mental well-being.

# What we learned

Throughout this project, we learned the importance of managing time and tasks effectively, especially when working with a tight deadline. We deepened our understanding of Firebase for real-time data handling and gained valuable experience integrating third-party APIs like Gemini into a dynamic web app.

# What's next for Mind Space

Next for MindSpace, we're developing a mobile app for greater accessibility and adding a mental health resource hub to support students. We plan to expand the platform beyond schools to universities and even workplaces, increasing its impact on well-being across different environments.
